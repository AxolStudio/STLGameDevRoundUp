# St Louis Game Developer RoundUp

This is the repository for the St Louis Game Developer RoundUp: a monthly news aggrigator for the [St Louis Game Development community](http://stlgamedev.com/).

## How to Contribute

EVERYONE IS ENCOURAGED TO CONTRIBUTE* 

It is simple and easy to contribute: read how [HERE](https://github.com/AxolStudio/STLGameDevRoundUp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).


*(as long as their contribution adheres to our guidelines)!

If you have questions or comments you can open a new Issue or contact [Tim I Hely](mailto:tim@axolstudio.com) for help.

## How it Works

The RoundUp site is a static website generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The site is hosted on Github Pages and is only updated when the Github Action to Generate a new RoundUp Issue is run.
For now, we will try to generate a new issue every other week - but that may change if we have more (yay!) or less news to share going forward.

When the Github Action is run, it looks at the open "next-roundup" Issue and generates a JSON file for it, then tells Hugo to build the stite. The site is deployed to Github Pages and then a Screenshot of the new issue is taken to be set as the Issue's thumbnail image.

Next, we generate a new Tweet, a Bsky post, and a Discord post with the new issue's link and thumbnail image.

Finally, the "next-roundup" Issue is closed and a new "next-roundup" Issue is created for the next issue.

## Who made this?

This was created by [Tim I Hely](https://github.com/SeiferTim) of [Axol Studio, LLC](https://axolstudio.com/).

The concept was unabashedly stolen from [Haxe.io](https://haxe.io/) by [Skial Bainn](https://twitter.com/skial) (but all the code is unique).
