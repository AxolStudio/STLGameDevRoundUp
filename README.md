# St Louis Game Developer Roundup

This is the repository for the St Louis Game Developer Roundup: a semi-regular news aggrigator for the [St Louis Game Development community](http://stlgamedev.com/).

## How to Contribute

If you have any news, announcements, or anything relevant to the St Louis Game Development Community that you would like to share in an upcoming Roundup, simply find the Issue for the next Roundup and leave a new comment with the format:

```md
{category} Your news info [Optional Link](https:/link/to/something)
```

You can add any markdown you want, really, but it *must* start with the category in curly braces. You can make up any category you want, but ideally you should try to match an existing category.
You should not include a whole ton of text, either - just a blurb that says what your news is about and then a link so someone can learn more.

If you discover an error or need to remove something from a live Roundup, you can edit the cooresponding `issue-number.json` file in `data` and submit a Pull Request. 

Simply change or remove the erroneous entry like this:

```json
[
    {
        "nodes":
        [
            {
                "body": "{news} Your news info [Optional Link](https:/link/to/something)",
            }
            // ---- remove from here
            ,
            {
                "body": "{news} oops we made a mistake [Optional Link](https:/link/to/something)",
            }
            // --- to here
        ]
    }
]
```

If you have questions or comments you can open a new Issue or contact [Tim I Hely](mailto:tim@axolstudio.com) for help.

## How it Works

The Roundup site is a static website generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The site is hosted on Github Pages and is only updated when the Github Action to Generate a new Roundup Issue is run.
For now, we will try to generate a new issue every other week - but that may change if we have more (yay!) or less news to share going forward.

When the Github Action is run, it looks at the open "next-roundup" Issue and generates a JSON file for it, then tells Hugo to build the stite. The site is deployed to Github Pages and then a Screenshot of the new issue is taken to be set as the Issue's thumbnail image.

Next, we generate a new Tweet, a Bsky post, and a Discord post with the new issue's link and thumbnail image.

Finally, the "next-roundup" Issue is closed and a new "next-roundup" Issue is created for the next issue.

## Who made this?

This was created by [Tim I Hely](https://github.com/SeiferTim) of [Axol Studio, LLC](https://axolstudio.com/).

The concept was unabashedly stolen from [Haxe.io](https://haxe.io/) by [Skial Bainn](https://twitter.com/skial) (but all the code is unique).
