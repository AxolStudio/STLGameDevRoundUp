I have been working on a casual puzzle golf game for mobile tentatively called 90° Golf and I need a pixel artist to replace the placeholder art I've been using and help solidfy the aesthetic for the game. There's not a lot of art in the game, but I'd like it to be high quality and charmingly animated. If you'd like to learn more please send some samples and your rates to super_wes on Discord, [@SuperWes on X](https://twitter.com/SuperWes), or [@superwes.bsky.social on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/superwes.bsky.social)."
