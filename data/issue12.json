I have tried to scrape all the latest Game Dev news relevant to our community from the web, and the goal is to always try to help raise the voices of the people out there that are struggling to be heard, but sometimes a few of the more well-known voices tend to drown out some of the others (through no fault of theirs!), so I worry about missing things... You can help by contributing anything that meets our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/AxolStudio/STLGameDevRoundUp/blob/ce5d5bc5c141351f99431609fa3c9cbe2d0914f2/CONTRIBUTING.md) - no matter how small or seemingly unimportant! We want to know about it!"
